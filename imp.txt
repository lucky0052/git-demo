This is the file which will be seen only in 
newtext1.txt file and solely in the newbranch.


I'm making some changes in newtext1.txt file by
rebasebranch.khkh



To delete the branch from the remote repository 
use the command git push --delete origin branchname


To delete the branch from the local repository 
use the command git branch -d branchname


To change the branch name we have to first change the name 
of the local branch then use the command to change the
the branch name git branch -m newbranch_name

Then push the new name of the branch to git repository
git push origin :oldbranch_name newbranch_name



Made few changes to check the diff but before staged.
