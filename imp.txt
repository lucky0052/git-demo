I'm making some changes in newtext1.txt file by
rebasebranch.khkh



To delete the branch from the remote repository 
use the command git push --delete origin branchname


To delete the branch from the local repository 
use the command git branch -d branchname


To change the branch name we have to first change the name 
of the local branch then use the command to change the
the branch name git branch -m newbranch_name

Then push the new name of the branch to git repository
git push origin :oldbranch_name newbranch_name
